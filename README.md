# BusinessAnalysisProject3 

In this project, I will create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. The data I will be using for the project comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.

## What is the Project All About?

I will be creating data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set using Tableau.

## What skills will I use?

The main goal of this project is for me to demonstrate my ability to:
- use Tableau in creating Visualizations. Both stories, dashboards
- use filters, tooltips etc.

## The Resulting File For The Project Will include:

- A PDF or Markdown report that includes the following sections:

- URL Links to a Tableau dashboards or story
